# practice-repository-shell

This is a repository to practice using Visual Studio Code and GitHub as well as how they interact with each other. I will be programming in python. The program will be a simple shell that the user can interact with. I believe this will be something that is simple but has a lot of oppurtunities for editing and additions which will help me gain experience using GitHub.
